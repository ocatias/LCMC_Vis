# Visualisation of Biaxial Liquid Crystals in Confinement
This is program is intended to visualize the simulations done [here](https://github.com/ocatias/LCMC_Sim/). It allows the user to look at the system from all angles and at different points in time. It can also automaticaly take screenshots of multiple systems and with different settings.

It is written for the Unity game engine and uses the [Unity Standalone File Browser](https://github.com/gkngkc/UnityStandaloneFileBrowser).

## Getting Started
Download the project and import it with Unity. Note that this program is intended to only run in the Unity Editor.

### Controls
* **W / A / S / D** - Rotate the camera
* **Q / E** - Zoom in/out
* **R** - Go one timestep ahead
* **T** - Go one timestep back
* **X** - Load a new simulation
* **+ / -** - Change the radius outside of which no particles are rendered

* **P** - Load multiple simulation and automaticly take screenshots from different angles and at different times (this seems to only works on Windows and not on Ubuntu)
